# How to deploy Capella

You can run a clone of Capella for development or usage as your own cloud service on production. There are two ways: Docker containers or set up environment by yourself.

## Docker

Make sure that you have installed [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

1. Clone this repository

```shell
git clone https://github.com/codex-team/capella
cd capella
```

2. In the repository's root build and run Docker containers

```shell
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

3. Run composer in PHP container 

Install all dependencies (including require-dev). Use it for development.

```shell
docker exec -i capella_php_1 composer install
```

If you need no dev-dependencies and you are going to run Capella on production then add flag `--no-dev`

```shell
docker exec -i capella_php_1 composer install --no-dev
```

4. Create `.env` config file and fill up params. (optional) 

You can copy env file skeleton from sample file `capella/capella/.env.sample`.

```shell
cp .env.sample .env
```

Capella uses [Hawk](https://hawk.so) as error catching service. You can create an account and add a new project.

5. Open [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081) and see
